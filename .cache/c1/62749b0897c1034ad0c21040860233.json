please stop asking.\r\n          </span>\r\n        \r\n        <h3>Geography (Geographic Information Science)</h3>\r\n          <span>\r\n            My degree in \"Where?\"\r\n            <br><br>\r\n            I've pursued two research topics. The first is voting. \r\n              I performed an analysis of where votes matter most, which you can see <a href=\"#Portfolio\">below</a>.\r\n              I'm also working on an algorithm to identify precincts with diluted voting power\r\n                to use as evidence of gerrymandering. That paper will be out before I graduate.\r\n              The second is indoor cartography. Our lab is building 3D models of indoor spaces from LIDAR scans\r\n                using deep learning and we're working on programatically generating millimeter-accurate models.\r\n          </span>\r\n        \r\n        <h3>Philosophy (Ethics and Public Policy)</h3>\r\n          <span> \r\n            My degree in \"Why?\"\r\n            <br><br>\r\n            My interests are primarily in political ethics and metaphysics.\r\n            I spent four years asking questions that spanned from \r\n              \"What is the least problematic normative theory that can be applied to the American criminal \r\n              justice system given the pervasiveness of societal inequities, the need to satisfactorily \r\n              balance incommensurate values, and the desire to maximize social good?\" to \"What is?\"\r\n          </span>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Abroad</h2>\r\n          <span>\r\n            I took a gap year during which I worked and then backpacked independently around South America for\r\n              about nine months. In that time my Spanish improved to the point of fluency, I volunteered with\r\n              WWOOF, and I took classes on local cuisine. I also did lots of hiking.\r\n          </span>\r\n          <span>\r\n          <br>\r\n            During the Fall of 2019, I studied abroad at King's College London, where I took advanced modules in \r\n              computer science and philosophy. It was an interesting time to be there since my stay coincided \r\n              with a Brexit deadline that was blown past and an election that resulted in the following Brexit \r\n              deadline being met. I gained a real appreciation for tea and crumpets.\r\n          </span>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Troop 52</h2>\r\n          <span>\r\n            Boy Scouts was a big part of my life growing up. I was an avid camper and climber as a\r\n              teenager. My freshman year of high school, I was the Patrol Leader of the Flying Bagels and\r\n              was awarded Scout of the Year by my troop. My Eagle Scout project was to rebuild a staircase \r\n              that was falling apart on a trail near my house, which we miraculously did in just one weekend. I\r\n              include Boy Scouts in the Education section because it's where I learned a lot of what I know \r\n              about leadership, self-reliance, and spiders (not to mention how to read a map).\r\n          </span>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"info\" id=\"Experience\">\r\n        <h2>SeaSketch</h2>\r\n          <span>\r\n            I just started at SeaSketch so I can't really say much about it.\r\n          </span>\r\n        \r\n        <h2>Apex Clean Energy</h2>\r\n          <span>\r\n            Apex Clean Energy is a wind and solar developer based out of Charlottesville, Virginia. My role \r\n              at Apex was to determine where to site new utility-scale facilities.\r\n            <br><br>\r\n            As an intern in the New Markets division, I dove deep into potential markets, found relevant data, \r\n              and presented my findings to members of the New Markets, GIS, and Business Development teams.\r\n              The types of research that I conducted included opposition analysis,\r\n              estimating the siting criteria of downstream industries, \r\n              and strategies for optimizing energy storage.\r\n              I ultimately presented the results of one research project directly to the CEO. \r\n            <br><br>\r\n            Since I was the GIS intern for New Markets, my research often relied on geospatial data. \r\n              I created numerous Python tools to assist both the New Markets and dedicated GIS teams, \r\n              including geocoders, web scrapers, and geometric manipulation scripts. \r\n              Many of my deliverables were service layers that were published to the company web map.\r\n              I also started a collaborative Python package, <i>Apyx</i>, to increase efficiency across teams by\r\n                generalizing common geoprocessing workflows.\r\n          </span>\r\n        \r\n        <h2>Primary Ocean Producers</h2>\r\n          <span>\r\n            Primary Ocean Producers is an aquaculture startup. They were awarded a contract by the ARPA-E \r\n              MARINER program to determine the most suitable regions in federal and state waters to grow giant \r\n              kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>). \r\n            <br><br>\r\n            My role as the GIS Specialist was to handle all of the non-binary siting factors and generate\r\n              presentable seasonal and annual suitability maps for the Southern California region. \r\n              Some of these maps can be found in my public <a href=\"#Portfolio\">Portfolio</a>.\r\n              I also coordinated with NOAA and ARPA-E to acquire data and document our progress as required.\r\n            <br><br>\r\n            This was my first opportunity to manipulate massive amounts of data. A lot of the datasets we used \r\n              contained tens of millions of values, and processing hundreds of these helped me learn how to \r\n              optimize my algorithms.\r\n          </span>\r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div class=\"info\" id=\"Skills\">\r\n        <table>\r\n          <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><h2>Human Languages</h2></td></tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">English</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">Spanish</td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Native\" title=\"Native\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Fluent\" title=\"Fluent\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n\r\n          <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><h2>Robot Languages</h2></td></tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">Python</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">R</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">SQL</td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Amazing\" title=\"Amazing\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">HTML</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">CSS</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">JavaScript</td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Amazing\" title=\"Amazing\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Amazing\" title=\"Amazing\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">C++ </td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">Java</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">Scala</td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/fa25c7de7840006e1c341939389f48f4.svg\" alt=\"Good\" title=\"Good\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/fa25c7de7840006e1c341939389f48f4.svg\" alt=\"Good\" title=\"Good\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n\r\n          <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><h2>Applications</h2></td></tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">ESRI</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">QGIS</td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\">ENVI</td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/5dcd8364e9476b02fd3813c044157741.svg\" alt=\"Amazing\" title=\"Amazing\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"><img src=\"/c87e1726f8f4f8631b368b44b7f6e252.svg\" alt=\"Great\" title=\"Great\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillName\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td class=\"skillImg\"></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </table>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <!-- Another transition -->\r\n      <div class=\"small-gradient-2\"></div>\r\n\r\n      <!-- Flip cards for portfolio items -->\r\n      <div class=\"flex-container\" id=\"Portfolio\">\r\n\r\n        <a href=\"/d0370de3c6ccffb78184745dd9724bfd.html\">\r\n          <div class=\"flip-card\">\r\n            <div class=\"flip-card-inner\">\r\n              <div class=\"flip-card-front\">\r\n                <img src=\"/69f791132d0e1db46da38e4b67f30a8b.png\" alt=\"GDVP\" class=\"flip-img\">\r\n              </div>\r\n                <div class=\"flip-card-back\">\r\n                  <h2>Geographic Distribution of Voting Power</h2>\r\n                  <p>An interactive map of where votes have mattered most in US federal elections in the past twenty years.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div> \r\n        </a>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"flip-card\">\r\n          <div class=\"flip-card-inner\">\r\n            <div class=\"flip-card-front\"></div>\r\n            <div class=\"flip-card-back\">\r\n              <h2 class=\"flip-title\">This website</h2>\r\n              <p>I wrote this website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including node.js and JQuery).</p>\r\n              <p>I thought of the template while hiking.
