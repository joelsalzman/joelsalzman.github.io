        <h2>University of California,<br>Santa Barbara</h2>
          <span>
            I will graduate Magna Cum Laude in June 2020 with two Bachelors of Arts. 
              I finished my Geography requirements last spring (the same term I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa)
              and am finishing my Philosophy degree this term.
              While in college, I've competed as part of the UCSB Climbing Team, 
              worked in the wilderness with UCSB Adventure Programs,
              and eaten lots of bagels with the Santa Barbara Hillel. 
              I don't surf though; please stop asking.
          </span>
        
        <h3>Geography (Geographic Information Science)</h3>
          <span>
            My degree in "Where?"
            <br><br>
            I have pursued two topics of research. The first is voting. 
              I performed an analysis of where votes matter most, which you can see <a href="#Portfolio">below</a>.
              I'm also developing an algorithm to identify precincts with inordinately diluted voting power
                for use as potential evidence of gerrymandering.
              The second is indoor cartography. Our lab built 3D models of indoor spaces from LIDAR scans using deep 
              learning classification techniques and we're working on programatically generating millimeter-accurate models.
          </span>
        
        <h3>Philosophy (Ethics and Public Policy)</h3>
          <span> 
            My degree in "Why?"
            <br><br>
            My interests primarily regard political ethics and metaphysics.
            My coursework has related to GIS through my studies of spatial ontology, logic, and data ethics.
          </span>

        <h2>Abroad</h2>
          <span>
            I took a gap year during which I worked and then backpacked independently around South America for
              about nine months. In that time my Spanish improved to the point of fluency, I volunteered with
              WWOOF, and I took classes on local cuisine. I also did lots of hiking.
          </span>
          <span>
          <br>
            During the Fall of 2019, I studied abroad at King's College London, where I took advanced modules in 
              computer science and philosophy. It was an interesting time to be there since my stay coincided 
              with a Brexit deadline (though I fortunately left before covid-19 struck). 
              I gained a real appreciation for tea and crumpets as well.
          </span>

        <h2>Troop 52</h2>
          <span>
            Boy Scouts was a big part of my life growing up. I was an avid camper and climber as a
              teenager. My freshman year of high school, I was the Patrol Leader of the Flying Bagels and
              was awarded Scout of the Year by my troop. My Eagle Scout project was to rebuild a staircase 
              that was falling apart on a trail near my house, which we miraculously finished in just one 
              weekend. I include Boy Scouts in the Education section because it's where I learned a lot of 
              what I know about leadership, self-reliance, and spiders (not to mention how to read a map).

        <h2>Apex Clean Energy</h2>
          <span>
            <a href="https://www.apexcleanenergy.com/">Apex Clean Energy</a> is a wind and solar developer based 
              out of Charlottesville, Virginia. My role at Apex was to determine where to site new utility-scale 
              facilities.
            <br><br>
            As an intern in the New Markets division, I dove deep into potential markets, found relevant data, 
              and presented my findings to members of the New Markets, GIS, and Business Development teams.
              The types of research that I conducted included opposition analysis,
              estimating the siting criteria of downstream industries, 
              and strategies for optimizing energy storage.
              I ultimately presented the results of one research project directly to the CEO. 
            <br><br>
            Since I was the GIS intern for New Markets, my research often relied on geospatial data. 
              I created numerous Python tools to assist both the New Markets and dedicated GIS teams, 
              including geocoders, web scrapers, and geometric manipulation scripts. 
              Many of my deliverables were service layers that were published to the company web map.
              I also started a collaborative Python package, <i>Apyx</i>, to increase efficiency across teams by
                generalizing common geoprocessing workflows.

        <h2>Primary Ocean Producers</h2>
          <span>
            <a href="http://www.primaryocean.com/">Primary Ocean Producers</a> is an aquaculture startup. 
            They were awarded a contract by the ARPA-E MARINER program to determine the most suitable regions 
              in federal and state waters to grow giant kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>). 
            <br><br>
            My role as the GIS Specialist was to handle all of the non-binary siting factors and generate
              presentable seasonal and annual suitability maps for the Southern California region. 
              Some of these maps can be found in my public <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a>.
              I also coordinated with NOAA and ARPA-E to acquire data and document our progress as required.
            <br><br>
            This was my first opportunity to manipulate massive amounts of data. A lot of the datasets we used 
              contained tens of millions of values, and processing hundreds of these helped me learn how to 
              optimize my algorithms.
