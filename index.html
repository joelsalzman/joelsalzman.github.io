                    <p>
                        Hey there!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I adore all things spatial.
                        My career began with geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial 
                            optimization.
                        I currently develop GIS tools for the New Markets division at
                            <a href="https://www.apexcleanenergy.com/">Apex Clean Energy</a>.
                        Ultimately, my goal is to have a hand in crafting spatial environments in 
                            mixed reality and generally leveraging spatial computing to make people's 
                            lives better.
                        That is why I am now applying to graduate programs in Computer Science — 
                            if that's why you're here, hello!
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not in front of a computer, I like to be out in nature.
                        Climbing, hiking, kayaking — if there's a fresh breeze or a pretty view, 
                            'm there for it.

                    Voting Power

                    <p>
                        This project began with a simple question: <b>Where do votes matter most?</b>
                        I grew up around DC and heard countless complaints about the undemocratic 
                            nature of our electoral system.
                        Feeling uniquely mobile approaching the end of college, I wondered where I 
                            could move such that my vote would be most impactful.
                        Perhaps I could move to Wyoming — maybe Maine — certainly not California, 
                            where I went to school, or DC, where I was born.
                        It is no secret that American politics overrepresent rural areas.
                        But I wanted to know exactly where places are unequally represented, and by 
                            how much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first iteration of this project was done as a group assignment for a 
                            class (GEOG 176C at UCSB).
                        I pitched the idea and got two terrifically talented colleagues 
                            (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanmirandasmc/">Juan</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-karlenzig-95890a154/">Owen</a>)
                        to join my team. 
                        I led the project for its three-month duration. 
                        The final product included a 
                            <a href="./pics/176c_poster.pdf">poster</a> 
                        that we 
                            <a href="./pics/176c_poster.png">presented</a> 
                        at the annual Geography Department symposium.

                    <p>
                        Afterwards, I was still curious, so I indepenedently expanded the analysis 
                            to consider every federal election since 2000.
                        The challenge here was incorporating redistricting since where votes matter 
                            most depends on which district those votes are cast in, and that changes.
                        Interpreting just the state of California, I gave a 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDqpWtp1WBY">lightning talk</a>

                        <a href="http://www.primaryocean.com">Primary Ocean Producers</a> was a 
                            startup aiming to cultivate <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> in the deep 
                            ocean, in partnership with Catalina Sea Ranch.
                        We were funded by a grant from 
                            <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/mariner">ARPA-E</a> 
                            to grow giant kelp en masse in order to produce carbon-neutral biofuel.

                    <p>
                        My role was to site the pilot facilities off the coast of California.
                        Along with two aquatic biologists, I developed a hierarchical suitability 
                            model for giant kelp cultivation.
                        Among other factors, we looked at chemical availability (for nutrients), 
                            geophysical phenomena (so the kelp would be safe), and legal 
                            restrictions (so we could build the facility).
