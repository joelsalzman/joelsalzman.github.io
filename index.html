                        Hello!

                    <p>
                        I adore all things spatial.
                        All I need for a pleasant afternoon is a new map and a cup of tea.
                        I currently develop GIS tools for the New Markets division at
                            <a href="https://www.apexcleanenergy.com/">Apex Clean Energy</a>.
                        My career goal is to help shape the spatial environments that emerge over my lifetime; 
                            in other words, develop AR and VR.
                        That's why I am applying to graduate programs in Computer Science — if that's why you're here, hello!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not in front of a computer, I like to be out in nature.
                        Climbing, hiking, kayaking — if there's a fresh breeze or a pretty view, I'm there for it.

                        This project began with a simple question: <b>Where do votes matter most?</b>
                        I grew up around DC and heard countless complaints about the undemocratic nature of our electoral system.
                        Feeling uniquely mobile approaching the end of college, I wondered where I could move such that my vote would be most impactful.
                        Perhaps I could move to Wyoming — maybe Maine — certainly not California, where I went to school, or DC, where I was born.
                        It is no secret that American politics overrepresents rural areas.
                        But I wanted to know exactly where, and how much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first iteration of this project was done as a group assignment for class (GEOG 176C at UCSB).
                        I pitched the idea and got two terrifically talented colleagues 
                            (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanmirandasmc/">Juan</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-karlenzig-95890a154/">Owen</a>)
                        to join my team. 
                        I led the project for its three-month duration. 
                        The final product included a 
                            <a href="./pics/176c_poster.pdf">poster</a> 
                        that we

                        My curiosity unsated, I indepenedently expanded the analysis to consider every federal election since 2000.
                        The challenge here was incorporating redistricting since where votes matter most depends on which district those votes are case in, and that changes.
                        For just the state of California, I gave a

                        It was my first foray into Leaflet and custom open-source web maps more generally.
